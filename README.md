# EMLPay
This is a bApp x Defi that displays our current EML and KLAY balance, allow us to transfer EML to other wallet addresses, and finally display transfer transaction history. 

This implements some methods in the caver-js library which were in turn used for interacting with the Klaytn blockchain
