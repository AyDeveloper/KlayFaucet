# KlayFaucet
KLAY Faucet sends a small amount of KLAY to the designated address for testing. It is important to note that you can run KLAY Faucet only once every 24 hours. In case the faucet balance is low, you can check back later. 

This implements some methods in the caver-js library which were in turn used for interacting with the Klaytn blockchain
